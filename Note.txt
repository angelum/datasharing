When constructing the plots for this assignment we were asked to save them to a png file with a width of 480 pixels
and a height of 480 pixels. By typing the command line for help on the png function: ?png, I observed that the default 
values for these arguments were as follows:

width = 480, height = 480, units = "px", .....

Since these values are set as default in R, it is clear that it is not neccesary to specify them for the this assignment.
